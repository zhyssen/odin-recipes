        <h3>Heavenly homemade sourcream blueberry scones</h3>
        <p>This recipe is adapted from two Martha Stewart
            recipes. I uses diluted sourcream instead of buttermilk
            because I always have sourcream on hand. It is a 
            pantry(refridgerator) staple. I also add a little bit
            of white vinegar to make it more of a buttermilk.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream, thinned with milk to make 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vinegar added to milk sour cream mixture</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, 2 for dough, 1 for eggwash</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder,
             and salt into a large bowl. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers,
              cut in butter until largest pieces are the size of peas. Stir in
               blueberries and lemon zest.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
            In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream, milk, vinegar, vanilla, and
             eggs. Make a well in center of flour mixture. Add cream mixture; stir 
             lightly with a fork just until dough comes together.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times 
            to bring together. Pat into a 6-inch square, about 1 1/2 inches thick. 
            Using a sharp knife dipped in flour, cut dough into four squares. Cut 
            each square in half diagonally to form eight triangles. Transfer to a 
            parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush tops with egg wash and sprinkle with 
            more sugar.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Bake until tops are golden brown, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool on sheet 5 
            minutes, then transfer scones to a wire rack and let cool completely.
