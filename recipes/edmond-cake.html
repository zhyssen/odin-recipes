        <h3>A Delicous Experiment</h3>
        <p>
            I came up with this recipe when I was cleaning out the pantry. I had a 
            bunch of tea biscuits (wafer cookies) and I didn't know what to do with 
            them. After spending hours going down the Pinterest rabbit-hole, I found
            recipes that used wafer cookies layered with pastry cream. After some 
            exprimentation, I made a version and took it to a pot-luck. My cousin's son
            said it was the best thing he ever tasted and asked for the name so his 
            mother could make it for him. I told him that I didn't have a name for it, 
            but since he liked it so much, I would name it after him. Edmond cake is born.

                    Place a layer of tea biscuits in the bottom of a 9 x 13 glass baking dish. 
                    Spread 1/2 of the pastry cream mixture evenly over the tea biscuits. Add another 
                    layer of tea biscuits and spread the rest of the pastry cream mixture over 
                    the biscuits and top with a final layer of tea biscuits.
