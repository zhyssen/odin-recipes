        <h3>Simple to Make Pastry Cream</h3>
        <p>This pastry cream recipe is adapted from Martha Stewart. It is one of
            the easiest pastry cream recipes I have every used. It turns out 
            great every time. 
                </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup corn starch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p> Whisk everything except the butter in a medium sauce pan. Once everything
                is mostly combined, add the butter. Bring to boil over medium heat stirring
                constantly. Let it boil for one minute, still whisking.
                 </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Place 
                plastic wrap directly on top of the custard making sure to get rid of 
                most of the air pockets. This will keep the custard from getting a hard
                skin on top.     
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                
                <p>
                    Refridgerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Whisk the custard well before
                using.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            </ol>
